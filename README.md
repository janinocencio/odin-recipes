Hi! This repository is a project about HTML skills only. This will not include any CSS nor JavaScript. Some of the skills I am going to display in this project are Basic HTML Structure, Elements and Tags, Texts, Lists, and Links and Images.

As the name implies, this is a website about food recipes that I like. If you like to cook, then this might be handy for you!

Just let me know if you need me to add more recipes so I can create additional webpage for you. Have fun browsing!
